        <p>Have you ever wondered why you never have anything left from your paychecks? Or does it always seem like it’s
            just a
            waiting game until the next check, or it’s a picking game between which bills get paid this month because
            you just
            can’t afford to pay. Well if you’re anything like me, then we’re in the same boat and you may be asking
            yourself how
            to switch things up to take control of your finances.</p>
        <p>Learning where my money goes and tracking it was the first step to my journey. Understanding this is a huge
            part
            because once you’re able to sit down and figure out what it is you’re spending your money on, then you’ll be
            able to
            figure out where you’re able to make cut backs and create opportunity for savings. </p>
        <p>So what’s a Saving’s Challenge?<br>
            Simply put, a saving’s challenge is when you save a set amount of money, depending on the rules of the
            specific challenge. It’s an easy and fun way to keep you focused on your goal and helps remind you of what’s
            necessary.</p>
        <p>So what’s this website for?<br>
            As a developer, I realize that there are not many online tools to help with savings challenges to track
            your
            progress. Theres plenty of options to get hands on books and PDF versions but I wanted something I could
            fill out
            online, thus the idea to create this site came along! </p>
        <p>So how does it work?<br>
            Considering taking on your finances is a big step, getting all the help you can is everything. On the
            resources
            page, you’ll be able to find different links and videos for help with your financial journey as well as
            additional
            resources to learn more about savings challenges! To actually access the challenges you’ll want create an
            account to
            get started and then pick a challenge to go from there! </p>
